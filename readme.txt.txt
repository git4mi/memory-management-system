 Memory Management System (OS Simulation)

 Project Overview

This project is a **menu-driven Memory Management System** implemented in **Python**, designed to simulate how an **Operating System allocates and deallocates memory** using different allocation strategies.

It demonstrates key **Operating System concepts** such as:

* Memory allocation
* Deallocation
* Fragmentation
* Comparison of allocation algorithms

---

 Objectives

* To understand how memory allocation works in an Operating System
* To simulate **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit** allocation algorithms
* To visualize memory usage and fragmentation
* To provide hands-on experience with OS memory management concepts

 Features

* Input custom memory blocks
* Allocate memory using:

  * First Fit
  * Best Fit
  * Worst Fit
* Deallocate processes
* Display current memory status
* Menu-driven and user-friendly interface

# Memory Allocation Algorithms Used

First Fit

Allocates the process to the **first available memory block** that is large enough.

 Best Fit

Allocates the process to the **smallest block** that is sufficient, minimizing wasted space.

 Worst Fit

Allocates the process to the **largest available block**, leaving larger remaining fragments.

Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Platform:** Windows (Command Prompt / Terminal)
* **Concepts:** Operating Systems, Memory Management
